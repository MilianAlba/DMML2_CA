# DMML2_CA
Data Mining and Machine Learning 2
There are four notebooks for the Hyperparameter tunning, per Data set - the scripts start by HP and they are self explanatory
InceptionResNet - Adam
InceptionResNet - Adagrad
MobileNet -Adam
MobileNet -Adagrad
Best results from each have been made it to the modelling phase,
IndoorModelbuit
OutdoorModelbuit
CombineModelbuilt

DMML2_augment_images.ipynb was used to augment the Outdoor data.
DMML2_project_segmented.ipynb was used to train a model for the laboratory segmented images using the Inception ResNet pretrained model and Adam optimiser.
